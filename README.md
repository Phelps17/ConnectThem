# ConnectThem
A simple strategy game based on connecting pieces, that connects multiple devices, regardless of platform.

#What it does
ConnectThem allows people to play a simple strategy game against one another, regardless of what platform they are on.

#How I built it
The server is built with Java and is hosted by Microsoft Azure. Both the PC client and the Android app were built with Java and CSS.

#Challenges I ran into
I ran into a lot of challenges trying to communicate over a busy network. I was unable to find a team to work with, and coincidentally faced a lot of pressure to meet milestones in time. I also faced a last minute challenge trying to multi-thread my server when I moved it to Azure, but was able to successfully adapt it. I was able to produce a decent looking GUI for the PC client and a functioning one for Android. Well I didn't have time to write clients fro WIndows Phone and iPhone before submission, I would love to finish them for the GitHub Repo to show the proof of concept.

#Accomplishments that I'm proud of
My biggest goal in this project was to learn more about network programming and implement it into my project. I was successful in doing that. I learned a lot about TCP data transfers, Azure, and moving a physical server to the cloud.

#What I learned
I learned a lot about TCP data transfers, Azure, and moving a physical server to the cloud. This was my first hackathon, so I also learned a lot about how hackathons work and what better strategies will be for next time.

#What's next for ConnectThem
I would really like to finish the mobile clients (iOS, Android, Windows) for this project to fully demonstrate its capabilities. I also had a great game twist in mind but thought of it too late and didn't have time to implement it, but would love to add it in the future.
